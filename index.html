                Hello!  I'm Nic Miesmer, and welcome to my portfolio! 
                </p>
    
                <p  id="about-me-text">
                     &emsp; I'm mostly a very laid back person, though I like to keep busy. 
                    I have many interests, and hobbies. I enjoy lifting, cycling, running, cooking, olympic fencing, video games, and programming.
                    I have been enjoying fencing for abouat a year and a half at school in Clevland called "Two Ravens".  It's a very
                    fun, and engaging sport both mentally and physically.
            
                </p>
                <p  id="about-me-text">
                    &emsp; I graduated from Hoover Highschool in 2006, then went on to recieve my BS in Computer Science from the University of Akron
                in 2013. Right out of school I got a job at Segmint Inc. working in their QA department before moving up to a position
                as a full stack dev (I consider myself junior even though my title doesn't state it).  I joined the Full Stack Bootcamp at
                Case West to gain more programming knowledge, and sharpen my skills.
